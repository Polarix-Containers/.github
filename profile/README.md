Polarix Containers is a collection of OCI containers aiming to improve security over upstream builds. Our containers are rebuilt and scanned daily.

We strive for maximum compatibility with upstream. Alpine and unprivileged users are used whenever possible. hardened_malloc is included in all Alpine and Red Hat UBI based containers.

Our number one priority is vulnerability patching. We will ship the latest version of packages as soon as possible. We will not pin package versions or hashes that we cannot maintain in a reasonable manner.
